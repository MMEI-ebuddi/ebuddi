  script: "Take off your inner gloves very carefully and slowly.\n\nPinch the outside
    of the gloves at the wrist. Peel the glove carefully and slowly away from your
    hand. Slide your index finger inside the other glove and take it off. Do not touch
    the outside of the gloves with your bare hands. Put it in the disposable waste
    bin. \n\nTrainee:\nThe important point to remember is that I am taking my gloves
    off without my gloves touching my bare hands. Watch carefully."
