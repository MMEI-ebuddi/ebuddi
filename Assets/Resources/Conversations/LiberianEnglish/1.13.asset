  script: 'Your hands are the most dangerous part of your body.

    They can be covered in the virus.


    It is too easy to touch your face. Maybe you have an itch or rub your eyes or
    touch your mouth.

    You can easily infect yourself with dirty hands if you do not wash them thoroughly
    and often. We will show you how to wash your hands properly in this training module.
    We will remind you many, many times to wash your hands. Never rush washing your
    hands.

    It is too important to clean them properly every time.'
