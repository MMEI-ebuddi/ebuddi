  script: "Well done. You have safely removed your PPE.\n\nLet\u2019s just try it
    again to make sure\n\nCongratulations, you have successfully removed your enhanced
    PPE, and completed the doffing section. If you would like to retry any of the
    sections in this simulation, you can return to the menu and use the posters to
    choose where to go. Well done!\n\nThat\u2019s not the right item to take off now!
    It\u2019s important to take your kit off in the correct order to ensure maximum
    protection. Have a look at the checklist to make sure you know the order, and
    when you are ready, try again."
