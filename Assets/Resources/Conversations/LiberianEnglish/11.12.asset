    the ties Pull gown very carefully away from your body. Do not touch the outside
    of the gown. It may be highly contaminated. Roll the gown keeping the dirty outside
    away from your hands. Dispose in the disposable waste bin. \n\nTrainee:\nSee how
    I carefully roll the gown with the outside of the gown rolled into itself.\nTo
    make sure I am clean, I will still wash my hands no matter how carefully I have
    removed my gown."
