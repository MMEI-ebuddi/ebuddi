  script: 'Your gloved hands are probably infected with the germs that were on the
    PPE.

    Always wash your inner gloved hands with 0.5% chlorine solution and throw some
    chlorine solution over the tap to wash off the germs.


    Dry your gloves with a clean towel and discard the towel in the disposal bin.
    Remember that you cannot see the virus and it is better to be safe and always
    wash your hand properly.'
