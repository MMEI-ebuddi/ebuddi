  script: In order to ensure that you have learnt the donning steps, you are now required
    to identify the right steps for donning without any help from Buddy. You will
    be shown a checklist at the start, and then you will select the equipment in the
    right order. If you select an equipment in the wrong order, then you will have
    to start again. You will have to identify the right order twice.
