  script: "This is your storeroom. It is where you keep your clean PPE supplies. You
    can see that there are many items to choose from. If you click on the equipment
    I will explain what that item will protect.\n\nThe face shield protects your eyes
    and face.\n\nGoggles protect your eyes and face and can be used instead of a face
    shield. \n\nThe face mask protects your nose and mouth and can be worn with the
    face shield or the goggles.\n\nThe hood protects the scalp, hair and neck. If
    you have long hair you will need a head cover for your hair.\n\nGloves protect
    the hands. You may need to wear an inner and outer glove for extra protection.
    \nIf you are cleaning then the outer gloves should be the thick rubber cleaning
    gloves.\n\nThe gown covers your upper body, skin and clothes.\n\nBoots protect
    your feet and legs.\n\nClosed toe shoes protect your feet.\n\nAn apron will give
    added protection for your upper body skin and clothes and should be worn if you
    may be exposed to a lot of body fluids.\n\nIt is best to wear scrubs under your
    PPE. "
