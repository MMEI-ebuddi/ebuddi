  script: 'Poor infection prevention and control can lead to infections among other
    patients, the closure of healthcare facilities and slowdown of essential services
    such as vaccinations and maternity care.


    The following actions will show how quickly infection can spread in a health facility
    if we do not use infection prevention and control.


    This module will then show how we can prevent the spread of infection by using
    basic infection prevention and control procedures.


    We can keep ourselves safe so that we can keep serving our patients and keep them
    safe. '
