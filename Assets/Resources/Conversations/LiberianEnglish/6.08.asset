  script: 'You must wear the correct size gloves because you must be able to do your
    work without problems. Before you put on your gloves, it is very important to
    check there are no holes. This would be very dangerous. Put your fingers in the
    right places. Pull the gloves over the gown so there is no gap. If there is a
    gap you need to find a larger gown because you must cover your wrists.

    Check they are not too tight.'
