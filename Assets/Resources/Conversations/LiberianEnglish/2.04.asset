  script: "Poor infection prevention and control can lead to infections among other
    patients, the closure of healthcare facilities and slowdown of essential services
    such as vaccinations and maternity care.\n\nThe following actions will show how
    quickly infection can spread in a health facility if we do not use infection prevention
    and control.\n\nThis module will then show how we can prevent the spread of infection
    by using basic infection prevention and control procedures.\n\nWe can keep ourselves
    safe so that we can keep serving our patients and keep them safe. \n\nIn the second
    part of this module we are going to use infection prevention and control procedures.\nWe
    have introduced an automatic 3 foot safe no touch zone around the patients.\nWe
    have made one of the rooms in the clinic an isolation unit.\nThis is where we
    will put all suspected infected patients.\nIf you click on the healthcare worker
    he or she will put on PPE.\nIf you click on the cleaner he or she will also wear
    PPE.\nFinally, if you click on an infected patient in the triage area he or she
    will go to the isolation ward for special care.\n\nNotice how quickly we can reduce
    the rate of infection spreading by using standard infection prevention and control
    measures.\nSee how a lot of infection happens outside the health centre. \nIt
    is very important that public health messages are used to prevent infection spreading
    through normal contacts. Why not go through the module again."
