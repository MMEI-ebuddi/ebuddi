  script: "As you can see the virus is found in all bodily fluids like vomit.\n  \nYou
    cannot see the virus in the vomit as it is very small. It still looks like any
    other vomit. It may be hard to tell if a patient has Ebola. So you must be very
    careful at all times.\n\nYou can catch the virus through any contact with the
    bodily fluids of a positive Ebola patient. Click on each of the red dots to learn
    about areas on the patient where you can easily catch Ebola. All bodily fluids
    are dangerous and even when the bodily fluids are on the bed clothes or the floor
    they are infectious and you must not touch with bear hands."
