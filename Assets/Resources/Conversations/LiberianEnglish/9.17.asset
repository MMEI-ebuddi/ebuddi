  script: In order to ensure you have learnt the donning steps, you are now required
    to identify the correct steps for donning without any help from Buddy. You will
    be shown a checklist at the start, and then you will select the equipment in the
    correct order. If you select an equipment in the wrong order, then you will have
    to start again. You will have to identify the correct order twice.
