  script: Check the gown to make sure there are no tears or has a factory fault. Put
    the gown on with the opening at the back. Tie the gown at the neck. It is good
    to tie the waste strap at the side so that you can untie easy. I can help you.
    Make sure there is no gap at the back. Ask your buddy to check.
