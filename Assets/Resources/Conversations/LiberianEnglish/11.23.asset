  script: "It is safer to remove your face mask without touching the front of the
    mask. Bend forward. In case there is any liquid on the face mask. Close your eyes.
    Remove the straps one by one, starting with the bottom strap. Next untie the top
    tie of the mask and hold the mask away from your face. Never touch the front of
    the facemask. Put the mask in the disposable waste bin. \n\nTrainee:\nI am tilting
    my head forward and removing the face mask by untying the straps at the back of
    my head."
