<b>ebuddi History</b>

ebuddi has been developed as part of the MMEI (Masanga Mentor Ebola Initiative) in collaboration Masanga Hospital UK and The Mentor Initiative.  Funded by The Daily Telegraph Christmas appeal 2014.  The application has been developed thanks to a wide range of experts across many disciplines and has been delivered in the following phases.

Phase 1 (pre-2015) Development was initiated working with the team at Immerse learning.  This initial delivery built upon input from a wide range of experts and formed the initial prototype.

Phase 2 (Feb 2015-Apr 2015) Development by PUPSMD & Total Monkery:  Leveraging concepts from the earlier work although not the code.  A 3D application was developed by Total Monkery and PUPSMD with additional expertise provided by The Mentor Initiative in Liberia and a range of external experts.  Fieldwork was conducted in health facilities in Monrovia, Liberia to test the potential of the program. The work involved quantitative and qualitative studies with raw feedback and end user opinion being used to fuel further development. PUPSMD conducted a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of the program in the field alongside Mentor.

Phase 3 (Apr 2015 - Nov 2015): Development by MMEI / Contractors.  Leveraging the pedagological work from phase 2 the app was re-written by a group of contractors across 14 separate disciplines.  Including significant input from Mentor, MMEI and health workers in the field. The field trials continued in Liberia and used rapid and agile feedback mechanisms to accelerate development and prioritize local input. Structured research studies were conducted by Mentor, during which close to 500 Liberian frontline healthcare workers were introduced to the program.  PUPSMD also continued the analysis using the Phase 2 module.

In addition to the re-write significant functionality was added including opening scenes, on tablet analytics, gamification and production quality graphics / usability. This was in response to field tests focusing on the operational use of the module and how best to apply it in different contexts, targeting end users with a range of resources and abilities.

Phase 4 (Nov 2015 - Jan 2016): Additional SQS module.  A completely new module was created to handle new requirements around triage work in Liberia alongside detailed server side analytics.  This was funded separately by USAID/OFDA.

Phase 5 (Jan 2016 - ... ): Mobile. Additional functionality has been developed to leverage the application on a smaller mobile platform allowing the involvement of a wider user base.  This involves a significant build out of the server side platform.

The module was developed alongside the rollout of frontline healthcare worker training conducted by the WHO.  Raw feedback was collected to compare the initial development from ebuddi triage to traditional training methods. It was apparent that target end users were much more confident using touchscreen interfaces than traditional computers.

##TODO list
Overall todo list can be found on trello https://trello.com/b/I9UdACr9/todo the major focus of work at the moment is to complete the cleanup removing the initial prototype code from Phase 2 particularly the animation work whilst expanding the functionality into the mobile space and building upon the server analytics.

There are also some //TODO tags in the code. Feel free to refactor marked code.
