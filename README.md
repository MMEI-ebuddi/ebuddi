# ebuddi

e-buddi© is a technologically enhanced adaptive learning tool which helps educate local communities about infection control, discouraging dangerous practices, behaviour and rituals. Its objective is to rebuild local health capacity faster, keeping health-workers, patients and communities safer.

The tool has been designed by a partnership under the Masanga Mentor Ebola Initiative (MMEI) between the Masanga hospital in Sierra Leone, the Mentor Initiative operating in Liberia, and the Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry (“PUPSMD”)
